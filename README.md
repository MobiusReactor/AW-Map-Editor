####Advance Wars Map Editor 

#####History 
This program is a map editor for the Advance Wars franchise, allowing users to create maps to share online.

There are already similar programs, such as the [AWS Map Editor](https://github.com/joaofrancese/awsmaped) by Roma_emu for AW1 - AW:DS, and my old [DoR Map Editor](http://mobiusreactor.com/aw-map/old/downloads/2015-07-06.zip). However, this editor is being written from scratch to implement features missing from previous editors, such as support for all four games, while still supporting the map file formats from the previous iterations.

The main motivation behind this project is to create a map editor which supports [Custom Wars: Tactics](https://github.com/ctomni231/cwtactics). To meet that goal, it should be as customisable as possible to support any custom features that may be added to the game.
